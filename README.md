## What did I build?

["London's Summer Internship Map](https://lxn848.github.io/my-first-map/)  Oakland Internships Map is a one-page, mobile-friendly web app that shows the locations of the three internships I completed during the summer all right here in Oakland. 

Users can...
1. **Toggle through all the maps**, Tap the buttons at the bottom of the screen to switch between all 3 internship locations. 
2. **Explore each map**Explore the map by zooming and dragging to look around the locations.

3. **See detailed itineraties** Click/tap each location to view images and a description of what I did there.

Here's a demo:

## Why did I build this?
I wanted a fun and easy way to showcase my internship experience to teachers, classmates, and friends. Instead of explaining each internship separately. 

I set these goals for my product:

1. Build a simple tech project I can continue adding onto my trello board. 
2. Practice organizing my ideas through tech 

## Tech stack

To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/), for generating the route lines, and exporting the geometries in `KML` format.
2. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), for publishing the app for free!
3.  [https://code.visualstudio.com/],as my code editor
4.  https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture GIPHY CAPTURE  is how I create my GIFs  on  Mac.
5.  https://trello.com/ this is how  it takes users to my README on your GitHub repository
